description: Ask your gavel panel (Codex + Antigravity models) + this Claude model in parallel, synthesize one fused answer, then act on it
argument-hint: "<task or question>"
---

You are running a **multi-model fuse** for this request. You (the Claude Code model) are a
**panelist, the judge, and the actor**. The advisors in your gavel panel (by default Codex plus the
Antigravity-backed Gemini 3.1 Pro and Claude Opus) are **read-only** - only you write to the
workspace or run side-effecting commands.

The task / question:
$ARGUMENTS

If the task is empty, ask the user what they want fused, then stop.

Follow these steps in order:

**1. Your independent draft (blind — before the panel).** As panelist #3, form your **own complete
answer first**, with no knowledge of what Codex or Gemini will say. Read whatever repo context you
need, then use the **Write tool** to save your full answer to a fresh temp file, e.g.
`/tmp/gavel-claude-<timestamp>.md`. This file is **your committed panelist submission**: it must
stand on its own (good enough to ship if the advisors error out) and include your recommendation,
key claims, assumptions, risks, and concrete next actions. Do **not** edit the workspace yet, and do
**not** revise this draft after seeing the panel — your view may change, but that change belongs to
the synthesis step, not to your original submission. This commit-before-reveal step is what keeps
your answer a genuine third input instead of you merely refereeing the two advisors.

**2. Consult the panel.** Get the task to the advisors **without putting it in a shell command** (so
quotes, `$(...)`, or backticks in the task can't break the command or inject shell syntax):

- **If the task is about this codebase, gather context BEFORE writing the prompt file.** The
  isolated advisors reason ONLY about what is in the text: only codex can read the repo, and only
  you can read the live cluster/services. So read the relevant files (and run any MCP/skill queries
  you need), then embed the concrete files, snippets, and live facts the blind panelists require
  directly in the prompt. Keep the user's task verbatim and put your gathered context in a clearly
  marked block above it. Guessing on their behalf is worse than over-including.
- Use the **Write tool** to write that prompt text to a fresh temp file with a unique name,
  e.g. `/tmp/gavel-prompt-<timestamp>.txt`. Delete it afterward.
- Then run this — only the fixed file path is in the shell, never the task text:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gavel.mjs" fuse --cwd "$(pwd)" --prompt-file /tmp/gavel-prompt-XXXX.txt
```

Notes:
- Codex explores your repo **read-only**; the Gemini and `agy-*` advisors run **isolated and cannot
  see your files**, so put any code/snippets they need directly in the task text.
- If a panelist shows `[error]` because its CLI is missing/unauthenticated, continue with whoever
  responded and tell the user they can run `/gavel:setup`. If the panel is empty, stop and say so.

**3. Judge & synthesize.** Now read **all committed submissions** - your own draft file from step
1 plus each advisor's output from the panel - and apply the **gavel-synthesis** skill to fuse them.
Your draft is a **fixed, co-equal input**, not a baseline to defend and not something to silently rewrite:
extract each panelist's claims separately, identify consensus, contradictions, partial coverage,
unique insights, and blind spots, then derive a **single fused answer**. Prefer claims supported by
≥2 panelists; resolve contradictions by correctness, verifying disputed/factual claims against the
actual code; never invent agreement.

**4. Present & act.** Give a brief fused conclusion plus a short note on where the three panelists
agreed or diverged — **including where your own draft differed** from the advisors and how you
resolved it. Delete the temp draft and prompt files. Then **take the appropriate action** grounded
in the fused answer — make the edits, run the commands, or deliver the final response. This "judge
then acts" step is the point of the command: don't stop at describing the answer when the task calls
for doing it.
